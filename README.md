# p5_riso_helper

This code pulls together a few of useful functions and adjustments in the [p5.js Riso library](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/) into one script.

Download all files, and then run with live server via VS code or another server. Would also work in the p5.js editor.  

Instructions are in console.
